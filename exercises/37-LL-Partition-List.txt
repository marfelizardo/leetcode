LL: Partition List ( ** Interview Question)
⚠️ CAUTION: Advanced Challenge Ahead!

This Linked List problem is significantly more challenging than the ones we've tackled so far.
It's common for students at this stage to find this exercise demanding,
so don't worry if you're not ready to tackle it yet.
It's perfectly okay to set it aside and revisit it later when you feel more confident.

If you decide to take on this challenge,
I strongly advise using a hands-on approach:
grab a piece of paper and visually map out each step.

This problem requires a clear understanding of how elements in a Linked List interact and move.
By now, you've observed numerous Linked List animations in the course, which have prepared you for this moment.

This exercise will be a true test of your ability to apply those concepts practically.
Remember, patience and persistence are key here!

Now, here is the exercise:

___________________________________



You have a singly linked list that DOES NOT HAVE A TAIL POINTER
(which will make this method simpler to implement).

Given a value x you need to rearrange the linked list such that all nodes
with a value less than x come before all nodes with a value greater than or equal to x.

Additionally, the relative order of nodes in both partitions should remain unchanged.


Constraints:

The solution should traverse the linked list at most once.

The solution should not create a new linked list.


Input:

A singly linked list and an integer x.


Output:

The same linked list but rearranged as per the above criteria.


Function signature:

public void partitionList(int x);


Details:

The function partitionList takes an integer x as a parameter
and modifies the current linked list in place according to the specified criteria.
If the linked list is empty (i.e., head is null),
the function should return immediately without making any changes.



Example 1:

Input:

Linked List: 3 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 x: 5

Process:

Values less than 5: 3, 2, 1

Values greater than or equal to 5: 8, 5, 10

Output:

Linked List: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10





Example 2:
Input:

Linked List: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2 x: 3

Process:

Values less than 3: 1, 2, 2

Values greater than or equal to 3: 4, 3, 5

Output:

Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5





Tips:

While traversing the linked list,
maintain two separate chains:
one for values less than x
and one for values greater than or equal to x.

Use dummy nodes to simplify the handling of the heads of these chains.

After processing the entire list,
connect the two chains to get the desired arrangement.



Note:

The solution must maintain the relative order of nodes.
For instance, in the first example,
even though 8 appears before 5 in the original list,
the partitioned list must still have 8 before 5 as their relative order remains unchanged.

Note:

You must solve the problem WITHOUT MODIFYING THE VALUES in the list's nodes
(i.e., only the nodes' next pointers may be changed.)

*/


========== DICAS ==============

Pseudo Code:

As you work through the pseudo-code,
I recommend sketching the nodes, pointers, and each step on paper.
This visual representation will greatly aid in understanding and tracking the process.


Check if head is null. If it is, the list is empty, so simply return.

Create two dummy nodes, dummy1 and dummy2, 
and initialize two pointers, prev1 and prev2, 
pointing to these dummy nodes respectively.

Initialize a pointer current pointing to the head of the list.

Start a while loop that continues until current is null:

Check if the value of the current node is less than the given value x. 
	I. If it is, 
	update the next pointer of prev1 to point to current, 
	and update prev1 to point to current.

	If it is not, 
	update the next pointer of prev2 to point to current, 
	and update prev2 to point to current.

Move current one step ahead (i.e., current = current.next).

Set the next pointer of prev2 to null, which terminates the second partition.

Set the next pointer of prev1 to the first node of the second partition (i.e., prev1.next = dummy2.next).

Update the head of the list to the first node of the first partition (i.e., head = dummy1.next).



This algorithm uses 
two dummy nodes 
and 
two pointers 
to maintain two separate partitions of the original list, 
one containing nodes with values less than x, 
and the other containing nodes with values greater than or equal to x. 

It then concatenates the two partitions and updates the head of the list accordingly.
